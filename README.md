In this small project I decided to take a BigQuery Public Data StackOverflow dataset and analyze it in Kaggle, here is the link to it: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/stackoverflow/data
I have formed 14 questions and wrote queries for them (I decided to take year 2018 as my primary range of data and take a small sample of data so I stay within the limits of 1GB) 
The list of questions is below:
- Percentage of questions ending with "?" that have accepted answers
- Tags more likely to have accepted answers
- Speed of answering for different tags
- Average number of answers for different tags
- 10 most viewed questions in 2018
- Distribution of question scores
- Average number of comments per question in 2018
- Top 10 most common words in question titles
- Average time between user registration and the first question
- Top 10 tags appearing together
- Distribution of answer counts for questions in 2018
- Most popular days of the week for asking questions in 2018
- Top 10 users with the most questions asked in 2018
